# Get FIFA players from the web

Your task:

- Read and store in a `fifa_df` DataFrame the HTML table data in this URL: https://www.fifaindex.com/players/top/fifa20_363/ which contains the top 30 FIFA players as of Oct.30, 2019.
- Remove the first two columns and the last one from the resulting `fifa_df` DataFrame, as they are `Unnamed` and filled with `NaN` objects.
- Create a `most_hits_player` variable containing the player with the most amount of `Hits`.
